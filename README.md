# Buffer Overflow and Vulnerability Analysis Using CNN and Binary Visualization

`Python 3.10.12`

`Jupyter Notebook (Python 3 ipykernal)`

`requirements.txt`

## (3) How the code is structured.
See `Report.ipynb`

How I did it was cleaned the data using `bash` then made `images` and `images2` using `img.py` oo

## (4) How to run the code, including very specific compilation instructions, if compilation is needed. Instructions such as "compile using g++" are NOT considered specific

See `Report.ipynb` to see/replicate the final project and view the results!

Use `requirements.txt` for dependencies using `python3.10.12` to replicate results in the notebook if you would like or you can just trust my results.  Do note, the dataset is very large and will take a very long time to train the CNN if you do decide to replicate the results.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Used `tensorflow` specifically for my `CNN`

`images2` is the dataset used and created by my script `img.py` (subset of `images`) of the obj files provided by `ROMEO` in `testcases`

`proof.log` is a proof on running `main.py` in additon to the notebook if you would like to view.

`weights.*` is a saved weight model for loading my model if prefered.

More specific details are in the markdown of the report itself as well!
